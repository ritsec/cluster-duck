# Processes

This section contains documentation on installation procedures, tasks that may
be performed more than once or twice, and any other processes which are
normally performed that may be helpful to document.

To document a new process, create a new markdown document in this directory.
Give it a short but descriptive name, and then document each step that is
performed. Make sure to add sufficient explanations of the steps so a reader
can understand what is going on. Remember, "self-documenting code" does not
exist! Also, try to include links to any pages you found helpful while writing
the process page.
