#### We ❤️ Pull Requests

A pull request does not need to be a fix for a bug or implementing something new. Software can always be improved, legacy code removed and tests are always welcome!

Please do not be afraid of contributing code, make sure it follows these rules:

* The change is readable and has comments, that aren’t superfluous or unnecessary,
* An overview or context is provided as body of the Pull Request. It does not need to be too extensive.
